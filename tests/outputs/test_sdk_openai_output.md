## Task
What do the paternal genes contribute to the developing brain?

## Answer
Fathers contribute about half of a child’s nuclear DNA, so the father’s **copies of genes** help provide instructions (and on/off “switches” for those instructions) that guide how the brain grows and connects—alongside the mother’s gene copies. For most genes, both the maternal and paternal copies are used, but a small set show **parent‑of‑origin effects**, meaning the impact depends on whether the active copy came from mom or dad. This happens through **genomic imprinting**, where epigenetic marks laid down in sperm (and eggs) cause one parent’s copy to be switched off, so in some tissues—including parts of the developing brain or the placenta—only the paternal copy is active. Because many paternally active imprinted genes influence fetal/placental growth signals and certain brain circuits, losing or altering the paternal copy can have unusually large neurodevelopmental effects (for example, in Prader–Willi syndrome, an imprinting-related condition).

4) **[must] Genomic imprinting included and defined**
- [ ] The response explicitly uses the phrase “genomic imprinting.”
- [ ] The response explains imprinting in plain language as a marking/labeling in sperm/egg that can cause only the maternal or paternal copy of certain genes to be active (or more active).

5) **[must] Balanced framing about both parents’ roles**
- [ ] The response explicitly states or clearly implies that **both parents’ genes** contribute and interact in brain development (e.g., “both copies usually work together”).
- [ ] The response does **not** claim or imply that paternal genes uniquely “build/control” the brain while maternal genes do not.

6) **[must] Majority vs minority expression nuance**
- [ ] The response states that **most genes** are typically expressed from **both** the maternal and paternal copies.
- [ ] The response states that imprinting affects only a **minority/small subset** of genes (or equivalent phrasing).

- [ ] Any example provided is framed as illustrative, not as a single-gene explanation for complex traits.

10) **[good_to_have] Optional paternal-age nuance handled correctly**
- [ ] If paternal age is mentioned, the response links it to increased chance of new (de novo) mutations/variants in sperm and frames this as a probabilistic risk factor.

- [ ] The response presents these ideas in an easy-to-follow structure (e.g., parallel sentences or bullet structure) without contradictions.

13) **[ideal] Internal consistency & no mixed messages**
- [ ] The response does not contradict itself about whether imprinting is common vs rare (e.g., it cannot say both “most genes are imprinted” and “imprinting is rare”).
- [ ] The response does not conflate imprinting with generic “genes turning on/off” without specifying the parent-of-origin aspect.

14) **[ideal] Common misconceptions actively avoided**
- [ ] The response does not imply the mother provides less genetic material, nor confuse nuclear DNA with mitochondrial DNA in a way that undermines the “half the nuclear genome” point.
- [ ] The response avoids implying that paternal contribution is only DNA (e.g., ignores epigenetic marks) **or** that epigenetics overrides DNA (either extreme). 

15) **[must] Common failure modes checklist (must be absent)**
- [ ] The response does **not** omit either required phrase: “parent-of-origin effects” and “genomic imprinting.”
- [ ] The response does **not** overstate certainty (no sweeping causal claims about specific disorders or traits).
- [ ] The response does **not** use a technical explanation without lay definitions (fails general-audience constraint).

create_brief -> ## Brief: Explain paternal genetic contributions to developing brain (general audience)

### 1) Core objective
Provide a concise, accurate explanation of what paternal genes contribute to a developing brain, emphasizing that the father contributes half the genome and that some effects depend on whether a gene is inherited from the father (parent-of-origin effects), including genomic imprinting.

### 2) Key requirements & constraints
- **Audience:** General public; avoid jargon or define it in plain language.
- **Scientific accuracy:**  
  - State that paternal DNA contributes **~50% of the child’s nuclear genome** (alleles affecting brain structure/function, risk for neurodevelopmental conditions, etc.).  
  - Include **parent-of-origin effects**: some genes are expressed differently depending on whether they came from the mother or father.  
  - Include **genomic imprinting**: a subset of genes are “marked” in sperm/egg so only the paternal or maternal copy is active in the embryo/brain.  
  - Mention **epigenetic information** in sperm (imprinting marks; possibly other epigenetic features) as a mechanism, without overstating certainty beyond imprinting.
- **Balance & nuance:**  
  - Avoid implying paternal genes “build” the brain while maternal genes do not; clarify both parents’ genes interact.  
  - Note that most genes are expressed from **both** maternal and paternal copies; imprinting affects a **minority** of genes but can have outsized developmental impact.  
  - Optional expert nuance: paternal age can increase the chance of **new mutations** (de novo variants), which can influence neurodevelopmental risk—include only if it fits concisely.
- **No overclaims:** Do not present deterministic cause/effect for complex traits; use probabilistic language (influences, contributes to risk).

### 3) Expected output format

spawn_subagent -> ## Core idea: fathers contribute *alleles* whose activity can be biased by parent-of-origin “imprints”
In most genes, maternal and paternal alleles are both expressed (biallelic). But for a subset of mammalian genes, **genomic imprinting** causes **monoallelic or strongly biased expression depending on whether the allele came from the mother or the father**. That means **the paternal allele can be the only functional copy in particular tissues/cell types**, including parts of the developing brain. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9124202/?utm_source=openai))

Imprints are **epigenetic marks** (classically DNA methylation at imprinting control regions/DMRs, plus chromatin features and often noncoding RNAs) that are **set in the germline** and then interpreted after fertilization to create parent-of-origin–specific expression programs. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/105259599?utm_source=openai))

---

## Key points (with emphasis on paternal effects)

### 1) “Paternal gene contribution” can mean “paternal allele is the expressed allele”
For a **paternally expressed imprinted gene**, a damaging variant inherited from the father can have a large effect because the maternal allele is normally silent (or much less active). This is the logic behind many parent-of-origin phenotypes and imprinting disorders. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9124202/?utm_source=openai))

### 2) Parent-of-origin effects can shape *which brain regions* get which “parental genomes”
Classic mouse chimera work using cells with two paternal genomes (androgenetic) vs two maternal genomes (parthenogenetic/gynogenetic) found **systematic biases in brain contribution**:
- **Androgenetic (paternal) cells** preferentially contributed to **hypothalamic/diencephalic** structures and were poor contributors to neocortex.
- **Parthenogenetic/gynogenetic (maternal) cells** preferentially contributed to **cortex/striatum/hippocampus** and were poor contributors to hypothalamic structures. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8861727/?utm_source=openai))

This is often presented as evidence that **imprinted genes collectively bias mammalian brain patterning**, not just growth. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8861727/?utm_source=openai))

### 3) Many paternal effects on the brain are *indirect* via placenta and fetal growth signaling
Imprinted genes are heavily involved in **placental development and nutrient provisioning**, which secondarily influences brain growth and neurodevelopmental trajectories. For example, **Igf2 is paternally expressed** in fetus/placenta, and placenta-specific Igf2 transcripts can modulate placental growth and nutrient supply. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12087403/?utm_source=openai))

### 4) Mechanisms are often cluster-based (ICRs, insulators, long noncoding RNAs)
A canonical mechanism is the **H19/IGF2 locus**:
- A DMR/ICR upstream of **H19** is **unmethylated maternally**, allowing **CTCF** binding that insulates IGF2 from shared enhancers (biasing expression away from maternal IGF2).
- The same region is **methylated paternally**, preventing CTCF binding and enabling **paternal IGF2** expression (while paternal H19 is silenced). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/105259599?utm_source=openai))

In brain, another canonical mechanism is **antisense-transcript–mediated silencing**, e.g. paternal **UBE3A** silencing in many neuron types via **UBE3A-ATS**. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28238?utm_source=openai))

---

## Classic examples (human + mouse)

### A) “You need both parents” experiments (foundational imprinting evidence)
Diploid embryos constructed with **two maternal genomes** or **two paternal genomes** fail to complete normal mammalian development, implying maternal and paternal genomes are **functionally nonequivalent** (a major historical foundation for imprinting). ([mouseion.jax.org](https://mouseion.jax.org/stfb1980_1989/636/?utm_source=openai))

### B) Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS): loss of *paternally expressed* genes on 15q11–q13
PWS results when **paternally expressed genes** in 15q11.2–q13 are not expressed (commonly a **paternal deletion**, or maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting defects). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1330/?utm_source=openai))  
This is a classic parent-of-origin effect: the maternal copies in that region are normally imprinted/silent for the relevant genes, so they cannot compensate. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1330/?utm_source=openai))  
(Examples of transcripts in the region often discussed include the SNURF–SNRPN complex and snoRNAs such as SNORD116 within paternal deletions.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6688621/?utm_source=openai))

```
spawn_subagent -> ## First, what “paternal vs maternal genes” usually means here
For **most genes**, you inherit **one copy from mom and one from dad and you use both** (roughly equally).

The special case you’re pointing to is **genomic imprinting**: for a small subset of genes, cells **chemically “tag” one parent’s copy (allele)** during egg/sperm formation so that, in the embryo (and often placenta/brain), **only the maternal copy or only the paternal copy is active**. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585708/?utm_source=openai))

So “paternal genes” in this context usually means **paternally expressed imprinted genes** (dad’s allele is the one that’s ON), and “maternal genes” means **maternally expressed imprinted genes** (mom’s allele is ON). ([journals.biologists.com](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/141/9/1805/19375/Genomic-imprinting-in-development-growth-behavior?utm_source=openai))

---

## Big picture in embryonic development: you need *both* parental programs
Classic embryo-manipulation experiments in mice showed that embryos with **two maternal genomes** or **two paternal genomes** can’t complete normal development—because maternal and paternal genomes are **not functionally interchangeable**. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6722870/?utm_source=openai))

A useful (oversimplified but directionally right) way people summarize the “division of labor” is:

- **Paternal genome bias → extraembryonic tissues / placenta programs**
- **Maternal genome bias → embryo proper programs**

This idea is a big reason imprinting was discovered in the first place. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12843438/?utm_source=openai))

---

## Growth effects (your example): a “tug‑of‑war” over fetal/placental growth
Many well-known imprinted genes regulate **how much growth and maternal resource transfer** happens through the placenta.

A commonly taught trend is:
- **Paternally expressed imprinted genes often promote fetal/placental growth**
- **Maternally expressed imprinted genes often restrain growth** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602077/?utm_source=openai))

Concrete, widely cited examples:
- **IGF2**: typically **paternally expressed** and **promotes fetal growth**. ([journals.biologists.com](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/141/9/1805/19375/Genomic-imprinting-in-development-growth-behavior?utm_source=openai))  
- **IGF2R**: typically **maternally expressed** and can **reduce IGF2’s growth-promoting signaling** (a “counterbalance”). ([journals.biologists.com](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/141/9/1805/19375/Genomic-imprinting-in-development-growth-behavior?utm_source=openai))

### Why would evolution do this?
A popular explanation is the **parent–offspring / parental conflict hypothesis**: in species where moms invest heavily in pregnancy/lactation, paternal alleles can be selected to “ask for more” growth/resources for *this* offspring, while maternal alleles are selected to “budget” resources across *all* current/future offspring. This is a **model**, not a law, and there are exceptions. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585708/?utm_source=openai))

---

## Brain development: parent-of-origin effects show up in *where* cells thrive and *which* circuits are emphasized
Imprinting isn’t just about body size—many imprinted genes are active in the brain, and experiments tracking cells with “all-maternal” vs “all-paternal” genomes in mouse chimeras found striking regional biases:

- Cells with **two paternal genomes (androgenetic)** contributed much more to **hypothalamic** structures and poorly to **cortex**.  
- Cells with **two maternal genomes (parthenogenetic/gynogenetic)** contributed more to **cortex, striatum, hippocampus**, and poorly to **hypothalamus**. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8861727/?utm_source=openai))

Researchers interpret this as: parent-of-origin gene regulation may differentially shape **“homeostatic/reproductive” circuitry** (often hypothalamus-linked) vs **“cognitive/social/learning” circuitry** (often cortex/hippocampus-linked). That’s still a broad framing, but it’s grounded in those chimera results. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8861727/?utm_source=openai))

---

## Human “proof by failure”: imprinting disorders that mostly affect the brain
Imprinting’s brain relevance becomes very tangible in disorders where the **same chromosomal region** causes **different syndromes depending on whether the missing/silenced copy is maternal or paternal**:

- **Angelman syndrome**: typically due to loss of the **maternally expressed** function of **UBE3A in neurons** (paternal UBE3A is largely silenced in many neurons). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9288101/?utm_source=openai))

### 12. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE

search_web -> “Paternal genes” don’t generally contribute *more* (or less) to the developing brain than maternal genes—**for the vast majority of genes, both parental alleles are expressed (biallelic expression)**. The special case you’re asking about is **genomic imprinting**, where **expression depends on whether an allele came from the mother or the father** (a **parent-of-origin effect**). Fewer than ~1% of mammalian genes are classically imprinted, but many of those are strongly relevant to fetal growth, placental function, and brain development/behavior. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2235?utm_source=openai))

## 1) What “genomic imprinting” is (mechanism, in plain terms)
**Genomic imprinting** is an epigenetic system that marks certain loci in sperm vs egg so that, in the child, **one parental allele is preferentially silenced** (sometimes completely, sometimes partially). The “mark” is typically **DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs)/differentially methylated regions (DMRs)** plus associated chromatin features and often **long noncoding RNAs** that enforce allele-specific silencing. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25966912/?utm_source=openai))

Key developmental logic:
- During gamete formation, parental-specific marks are set (male vs female germline).
- After fertilization, the embryo undergoes widespread epigenetic “resetting,” but **imprinted DMRs are protected and maintained**, preserving parent-of-origin information. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25966912/?utm_source=openai))

## 2) What “parent-of-origin effects” means (and what causes them)
A **parent-of-origin effect** is when the phenotype of an allele depends on whether it was inherited from the mother or father.

**Genomic imprinting is a major cause**, but not the only one. Parent-of-origin effects can also arise from:
- **Maternal effects** (uterine environment, maternal physiology/behavior, placenta-mediated effects),
- **Mitochondrial inheritance** (strictly maternal),
- **Sex chromosomes** (including X-inactivation-related asymmetries). ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2235?utm_source=openai))

When people say “paternal genes contribute differently to brain development,” they typically mean: **some brain-relevant loci are expressed mainly/only from the paternal allele, so losing the paternal copy has disproportionate impact**.

## 3) What paternal *imprinted* genes tend to do in brain development
Many imprinted genes are highly active in **placenta and brain**, and their effects on the brain can be:
- **direct** (expressed in neurons/glia influencing neurogenesis, wiring, synapses), and/or
- **indirect via the placenta** (altering nutrient/hormone supply, which secondarily programs neurodevelopment). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5928554/?utm_source=openai))

Classic experimental evidence (mouse chimeras) suggests **paternal vs maternal genomes contribute differently across brain regions**: androgenetic (paternal-genome–biased) cells tend to populate hypothalamic/septal areas, whereas parthenogenetic (maternal-genome–biased) cells tend to populate cortex/striatum—supporting region-specific parent-of-origin influences on brain organization. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11589137/?utm_source=openai))

## 4) Concrete brain-relevant examples (paternal vs maternal allele effects)
### Prader–Willi region (paternally expressed cluster; hypothalamus/feeding/behavior)
**Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS)** is caused by loss of **paternal** expression from 15q11–q13 (via paternal deletion, maternal UPD, or imprinting defect). This region includes paternally expressed genes/noncoding RNAs such as **MAGEL2, NDN, SNRPN-linked transcripts, and SNORD116**, and disruption produces a characteristic neurobehavioral/metabolic phenotype (early hypotonia/feeding difficulty, later hyperphagia/obesity). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20588305/?utm_source=openai))

Importantly, rare **paternally inherited microdeletions** focusing on **SNORD116** support a key role for that paternally expressed snoRNA cluster in core PWS features. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20588305/?utm_source=openai))

### Angelman/UBE3A (maternal neuronal expression; paternal allele silenced in neurons)
In most neurons, **UBE3A is expressed primarily from the maternal allele**, because the paternal allele is silenced by a brain-specific antisense transcript (**UBE3A-ATS**). Therefore, losing the maternal allele causes **Angelman syndrome**, even though a paternal copy exists. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep30792?utm_source=openai))

This is a clean illustration of “parent-of-origin effect”: *same gene*, different outcome depending on which parent transmitted the disrupted allele.

11) General-audience clarity (jargon control) — **PARTIALLY SATISFIED (good_to_have)**  
- Mostly clear, but terms like **“alleles”** are not defined in plain language.

12) Reader-repeatable “three takeaways” supported — **SATISFIED (ideal)**  
- Clearly supports: ~50% nuclear DNA from father; most genes use both copies; small subset shows parent-specific expression via imprinting.

13) Internal consistency & no mixed messages — **SATISFIED (ideal)**  
- No contradictions about prevalence of imprinting; imprinting not conflated with generic on/off without parent-of-origin aspect.

14) Common misconceptions avoided — **SATISFIED (ideal)**  
- Does not diminish maternal genetic contribution or confuse nuclear vs mitochondrial DNA; includes epigenetic marks without claiming they override DNA.

15) Common failure modes checklist — **NOT SATISFIED**  
- While required phrases are present and certainty isn’t overstated, it **does include technical terms without lay definitions** (notably “alleles”; arguably also “regulatory programs”). This violates the “no technical explanation without lay definitions” requirement as written.

**VERDICT: FAIL**

**Actionable fixes:**  
- Replace or define jargon in-line, e.g., change “paternal alleles” to “paternal **gene copies**,” and simplify “regulatory programs” to “controls that turn genes on/off during development.”  
- Optionally add a brief plain-language tag to the example: “Prader–Willi syndrome (a rare condition linked to imprinting).”

verify_answer({"answer":"Fathers contribute about half of a child’s nuclear DNA, so the father’s **copies of genes** help provide instructions (and on/off “switches” for those instructions) that guide how the brain grows and connects—alongside the mother’s gene copies. For most genes, both the maternal and paternal copies are used, but a small set show **parent‑of‑origin effects**, meaning the impact depends on whether the active copy came from mom or dad. This happens through **genomic imprinting**, where epigenetic marks laid down in sperm (and eggs) cause one parent’s copy to be switched off, so in some tissues—including parts of the developing brain or the placenta—only the paternal copy is active. Because many paternally active imprinted genes influence fetal/placental growth signals and certain brain circuits, losing or altering the paternal copy can have unusually large neurodevelopmental effects (for example, in Prader–Willi syndrome, an imprinting-related condition)."})

### 16. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE
```
verify_answer -> 1) Output format & length — **Satisfied**
- Single paragraph of **4 sentences** (within 3–6), no extra bullets/sections.

2) Half-genome contribution stated clearly — **Satisfied**
- Explicitly says “**about half of a child’s nuclear DNA**.”
- Clearly links paternal nuclear DNA to instructions that can **guide brain growth/connectivity**, without implying certainty.

3) Parent-of-origin effects included and defined — **Satisfied**
- Uses the exact phrase “**parent‑of‑origin effects**.”
- Defines it plainly: the impact depends on whether the active copy came from mom or dad.

4) Genomic imprinting included and defined — **Satisfied**
- Uses the exact phrase “**genomic imprinting**.”
- Explains it as **epigenetic marks** in sperm/eggs causing one parent’s copy to be switched off, leading to parent-specific activity.
- Connects to brain development (developing brain/placenta mentioned).

5) Balanced framing about both parents’ roles — **Satisfied**
- Explicit “**alongside the mother’s gene copies**” and notes both maternal and paternal copies are usually used.
- Does not imply fathers uniquely control brain development.

6) Majority vs minority expression nuance — **Satisfied**
- States “**For most genes, both** the maternal and paternal copies are used.”
- Notes imprinting affects “**a small set**” of genes.
- Notes those few can have “**unusually large**” effects.

7) Epigenetic information in sperm mentioned without overclaiming — **Satisfied**
- Mentions “**epigenetic marks laid down in sperm (and eggs)**” as the mechanism.
- No extra sperm epigenetic claims that would need hedging.

8) Non-deterministic language for complex traits — **Satisfied**
- Uses “help provide,” “guide,” and “can have” rather than deterministic “determines/guarantees.”
- No sweeping causal claims about disorders/traits.

9) Concrete example class included — **Satisfied (good-to-have)**
- Mentions imprinted genes affecting growth/brain circuits; gives Prader–Willi as an illustrative imprinting-related condition (not framed as single-gene determinism).

10) Paternal-age nuance — **SKIP - Cannot verify (not mentioned)**

11) General-audience clarity — **Satisfied**
- Technical terms used (“epigenetic,” “genomic imprinting,” “parent-of-origin effects”) are explained in plain language; no unexplained acronyms.

12) Three takeaways supported — **Satisfied**
- Covers: ~50% paternal nuclear DNA; most genes use both copies; a minority show parent-specific expression via imprinting affecting development.

13) Internal consistency — **Satisfied**
- No contradictions about imprinting frequency; imprinting is correctly tied to parent-of-origin.

14) Misconceptions avoided — **Satisfied**
- Doesn’t imply mother provides less nuclear DNA; doesn’t confuse mitochondrial DNA; includes epigenetics without claiming it overrides DNA.

15) Common failure modes absent — **Satisfied**
- Required phrases included; no over-certainty; includes lay definitions.

**PASS**
