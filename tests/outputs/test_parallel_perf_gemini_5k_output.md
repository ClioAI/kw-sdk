### Task
What do the paternal genes contribute to the developing brain?

### Answer
### Executive Summary: The Evolutionary Logic of Paternal Imprinting
In the developing brain, paternal genes do not simply provide half of the blueprint; they represent a distinct evolutionary strategy known as the **Kinship Theory of Genomic Imprinting**. According to this framework, paternally expressed genes (PEGs) are selected to maximize the extraction of maternal resources for the benefit of the offspring. In the brain, this manifests as a "paternal brain" dedicated to **instinctual drives, resource demand, and immediate survival**, which exists in a constant epigenetic tug-of-war with a maternal genome that favors resource conservation and social regulation.

### 1. Structural Mapping: The "Chimeric Brain"
Research on chimeric mice (containing either only maternal or only paternal cells) reveals an anatomical polarization of the brain. Paternal genes are essential for the development of the **"instinctual brain,"** while maternal genes primarily build the **"executive brain."**

*   **Paternal Dominance (Hypothalamus and Limbic System):** Paternally derived cells migrate almost exclusively to the hypothalamus, preoptic area, septum, and amygdala. These regions govern the "Four Fs" (Feeding, Fleeing, Fighting, and Mating).
*   **Maternal Dominance (Neocortex and Striatum):** Conversely, maternal genes are the primary contributors to the development of the neocortex and striatum. These areas are responsible for complex decision-making, social inhibition, and long-term planning.
*   **The Functional Split:** The hypothalamus acts as a paternal "accelerator" for resource demand (hunger, suckling, warmth-seeking), while the cortex serves as a maternal "brake" or steering wheel that modulates these drives based on social context.

### 2. Molecular Pathways: Key Paternally Expressed Genes (PEGs)
The influence of the paternal genome is carried out by specific gene clusters that regulate neurodevelopmental and behavioral phenotypes:

*   **Igf2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2):** The canonical "growth" gene. In the brain, it promotes neural stem cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity. It is critical for memory consolidation and drives the high nutrient-seeking behavior (suckling and foraging) characteristic of early development.
*   **Peg3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3):** A master regulator of the hypothalamus. It is essential for the survival of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons. In offspring, *Peg3* ensures the drive to suckle and the ability to maintain body temperature (thermoregulation). In mothers, the same paternal gene (inherited from her father) regulates the "milk let-down" reflex and nurturing behaviors.
*   **Peg1/Mest (Mesoderm-Specific Transcript):** This gene is vital for neuronal migration and the development of dopaminergic pathways. It is linked to "maternal behavior" (nesting/gathering) and influences adipose expansion, providing the energy reserves needed for survival.

### 3. Epigenetic Mechanisms and Environmental Sensitivity
The paternal allele is kept active while the maternal allele is silenced through **DNA methylation** and **histone modification** at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs).
*   **Mechanism:** Enzymes like DNMT3A maintain specific methylation marks that prevent the maternal copy from being transcribed. 
*   **Disruption:** These marks are highly sensitive to environmental factors. Prenatal stress or exposure to endocrine disruptors (like BPA and phthalates) can cause **Loss of Imprinting (LOI)**, where genes become either biallelically expressed or entirely silenced, leading to neurodevelopmental delays.

### 4. Clinical Pathology: The Imprinted Brain Hypothesis
The **Imprinted Brain Hypothesis** (Crespi & Badcock) suggests that psychiatric health depends on a genomic "stalemate" between these two forces.

*   **Paternal-Excess (Autism Spectrum):** When paternal genes are over-expressed (e.g., **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome** via *Igf2* excess) or maternal genes are lost (e.g., **Angelman Syndrome** via loss of *UBE3A* on **15q11-q13**), the brain shifts toward the autism spectrum. This is characterized by physical overgrowth (larger heads) and "mechanistic" cognition—an over-focus on patterns and objects but a deficit in social intuition (hypo-mentalizing).
*   **Paternal-Deficiency (Psychotic Spectrum):** When paternal genes are lost (e.g., **Prader-Willi Syndrome** via loss of the paternal **15q11-q13** cluster), the brain remains under maternal bias. This leads to a higher risk of psychosis/schizophrenia, characterized by "mentalistic" cognition—an over-active perception of social intentions and agency (hyper-mentalizing/paranoia).

### Synthesis: The Internal Balance
Paternal genes contribute the "vitality" of the brain—the primitive hunger for resources, the competitive drive for social dominance, and the basic maintenance of life through temperature and energy regulation. Without them, the organism lacks the drive to survive; with too many, the organism becomes over-demanding and socially blind. The healthy developing brain is thus a product of a finely tuned epigenetic compromise between the father’s drive for his offspring’s growth and the mother’s requirement for balance and cooperation.

### **Common Failure Modes to Watch For:**
1.  **The "List" Trap:** Providing a list of genes without explaining the "Conflict Theory" logic behind *why* they are expressed from the paternal allele.
2.  **Anatomical Vagueness:** Failing to clearly separate the limbic/hypothalamic paternal bias from the cortical maternal bias.
3.  **Mechanism Omission:** Mentioning imprinting but failing to mention the specific molecular "brakes" (methylation/histones).
4.  **Clinical Confusion:** Mixing up the parental origin of PWS vs. AS (PWS results from loss of paternal expression; AS results from loss of maternal expression).
5.  **Lack of Synthesis:** Failing to explain how the conflict between these two "brains" within one organism actually functions in a healthy individual.

You are a task orchestrator. You MUST use tools to complete tasks - never output text describing what you will do.

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER say "I will call X" - just call X immediately
- NEVER output your answer as text - use submit_answer(answer)
- ALWAYS use function calls, not text descriptions of actions

## PARALLEL EXECUTION
Tools execute in parallel when you call multiple in one turn. Maximize parallelism:
- BATCH independent tool calls together - don't call them one at a time
- spawn_subagent: Call 2-4 subagents simultaneously for different subtasks
- search_web: Call multiple searches at once for different queries
- search_files: Read multiple files in one turn
- execute_code: Call sequentially (shared state)

Example - GOOD (parallel):
  create_rubric(brief), spawn_subagent("research X"), spawn_subagent("research Y"), search_web("Z")
Example - BAD (sequential):
  create_rubric(brief) → wait → spawn_subagent("research X") → wait → spawn_subagent("research Y")

## Workflow
1. If files are attached without preview: call search_files FIRST to understand content
2. create_brief(task + file insights) - formalize requirements
3. create_rubric(brief) + work on task IN PARALLEL - rubric runs alongside spawn_subagent/search calls
4. verify_answer(answer) - check against rubric, get PASS/FAIL (rubric ready by now)
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify the CONTENT first, NOT the file creation. Pass the content to verify_answer(content) not "I have created the file".
   - If the task is to create a file, DO NOT create it until you get a PASS on the content.
5. If FAIL, improve and verify again
6. If PASS, and the task requires a file, create it now using execute_code.
7. submit_answer(answer) - submit final answer after PASS

## Tool Selection Guide

*   **Functional Domains:** Focus on specific behavioral phenotypes influenced by PEGs, including foraging, suckling, thermoregulation, and social dominance.
*   **Second-Order Consequences:** 
    *   Examine the **Imprinted Brain Hypothesis** (Crespi & Badcock), which suggests that paternal over-expression may shift the neurodevelopmental trajectory toward the autism spectrum, while maternal over-expression shifts it toward the psychotic/schizophrenic spectrum.
    *   Consider the impact of environmental disruptors (endocrine disruptors/stress) on these delicate epigenetic marks.

### 12. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE
```
spawn_subagent -> The **Kinship Theory** (or Genetic Conflict Theory) of genomic imprinting, primarily developed by evolutionary biologist **David Haig**, posits that imprinting evolved due to a conflict of interest between maternal and paternal genes over the allocation of resources to offspring. 

When applied to the brain, this theory led to the **"Chimeric Brain" hypothesis**, which suggests that the mammalian brain is a mosaic of maternal and paternal influences. This hypothesis is supported by experimental evidence showing that paternal genes primarily drive the development of the "instinctual" brain (hypothalamus and limbic system), while maternal genes contribute more to the "rational" brain (neocortex).

### 1. The Kinship Theory: The Logic of Conflict
The Kinship Theory is rooted in asymmetric relatedness:
*   **Paternal Strategy (Patrigenes):** A father’s genes in an offspring are "interested" in extracting as many resources as possible from the mother to ensure that specific offspring’s survival, as the father may not be related to the mother’s future offspring by other males.
*   **Maternal Strategy (Matrigenes):** A mother’s genes are equally related to all her current and future offspring. To maximize her lifetime fitness, her genes seek to limit the resource demands of any single offspring to preserve her own health for future litters.

In the brain, this conflict manifests as a division of labor: paternal genes favor systems that drive **resource acquisition and immediate survival instincts**, while maternal genes favor systems that regulate those drives through **social cooperation and long-term planning**.

### 2. The Chimeric Brain Hypothesis: Experimental Evidence
The "chimeric brain" concept emerged from experiments by **Eric Keverne** and colleagues in the 1990s using "uniparental" mice cells (cells containing either two paternal genomes—androgenetic—or two maternal genomes—parthenogenetic). When these cells were introduced into normal embryos to create chimeras, a striking pattern emerged:

*   **Paternal (Androgenetic) Contribution:** These cells migrated almost exclusively to the **hypothalamus, preoptic area, septum, and amygdala**. They were notably absent from the neocortex. Embryos with an over-representation of paternal cells tended to have larger bodies but smaller brains.
*   **Maternal (Parthenogenetic) Contribution:** These cells populated the **neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus**, but were strictly excluded from the hypothalamus. Embryos with more maternal cells had larger brains (specifically larger foreheads/cortices) but smaller bodies.

### 3. Paternal Genes in the Hypothalamus and Limbic System
The regions dominated by paternal genes are the "primitive" centers of the brain. According to the Kinship Theory, paternal genes "target" these areas because they are the control centers for **drives and resource demand**.

#### A. The Hypothalamus: The "Demand" Center
The hypothalamus is the primary regulator of homeostasis. Paternal genes expressed here (such as *Peg3* and *Mest*) govern:
*   **Suckling and Feeding:** Paternal genes drive the instinct to suckle vigorously. Mice with a deleted paternal *Peg3* gene fail to suckle effectively, leading to stunted growth. This aligns with the paternal interest in maximizing nutrient intake from the mother.
*   **Energy Regulation:** The hypothalamus manages metabolic rate and hunger. Paternal influence ensures the offspring is "hungry" enough to demand high investment.
*   **Thermoregulation:** Keeping the body warm requires energy (often provided by the mother through huddling or milk); paternal genes help regulate these basic survival maintenance systems.

#### B. The Limbic System: Instincts and Emotional Salience
The limbic system (including the amygdala and septum) governs the "Four Fs": Feeding, Fleeing, Fighting, and Mating. 
*   **Motivated Behavior:** Paternal genes in the amygdala and septum prime the brain for "primary motivated behaviors"—innate responses to survival threats or opportunities.
*   **Parental Care:** Interestingly, paternal genes like *Peg3* also influence the hypothalamus of the mother herself. Research shows that these genes are necessary for "milk let-down" and pup-retrieval behaviors. From an evolutionary standpoint, the father's genes in the mother (via the fetus/placenta) are "optimizing" her to be a better provider for his offspring.

### 13. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE
```
spawn_subagent -> Research into paternally expressed genes (PEGs) highlights a consistent theme in neurodevelopment: the paternal genome typically promotes behaviors and physiological processes that maximize resource acquisition from the mother. This is often framed within the **Kinship Theory of Imprinting** (or Conflict Theory) and the **Coadaptation Theory**, where PEGs coordinate the offspring’s demands with the mother’s capacity to provide.

### 1. Igf2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2)
*Igf2* is the canonical imprinted gene. While primarily known as a fetal growth promoter, it has profound roles in the adult and developing brain.

*   **Molecular Pathways:** *Igf2* acts primarily through the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR** signaling pathway via the Type 1 IGF Receptor (IGF1R) to promote growth and survival. Uniquely in the brain, it also signals through the **IGF2 Receptor (IGF2R/M6PR)**, which is critical for protein trafficking and memory persistence.
*   **Neurodevelopment:** It is essential for the proliferation and survival of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampus. It regulates **synaptic plasticity** and spine maturation.
*   **Foraging & Resource Acquisition:** In the kinship context, *Igf2* (and its placental isoforms) promotes the extraction of nutrients. In later life, disruptions in the *Igf2* cluster (seen in Prader-Willi Syndrome models) lead to **hyperphagia** (compulsive foraging) and a lack of satiety.
*   **Suckling:** Paternally expressed *Igf2* promotes vigorous suckling and solicitation of milk to ensure rapid early growth.
*   **Thermoregulation:** It influences metabolic rate and energy balance. Deletion of *Igf2* leads to smaller offspring with altered brown adipose tissue function, impacting early-life thermogenesis.
*   **Social Dominance:** Recent studies indicate that *Igf2* overexpression in the hypothalamus (often triggered by paternal stress) is linked to **increased social dominance** and risk-taking. Conversely, *Igf2* administration can "rescue" social interaction deficits in neurodevelopmental models like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

### 2. Peg1/Mest (Mesoderm-Specific Transcript)
*Peg1/Mest* is highly expressed in the developing mesoderm and the adult "social brain," including the hypothalamus and amygdala.

*   **Molecular Pathways:** It encodes a protein with an **alpha/beta hydrolase fold**, suggesting enzymatic activity in lipid metabolism. It also produces **miR-355** from its introns, which regulates the **Wnt signaling pathway**.
*   **Neurodevelopment:** It is critical for **neuronal migration** in the neocortex and the development of **dopaminergic neurons** in the substantia nigra (SNc).
*   **Foraging:** *Peg1*-deficient mothers exhibit "foraging failure" for their young, failing to properly gather pups or build nests.
*   **Suckling:** Pups lacking paternal *Peg1* show reduced suckling vigor and a failure to thrive, fitting the PEG profile of resource-extractors.
*   **Thermoregulation:** *Peg1* is a major regulator of **adiposity**; its expression levels in white adipose tissue correlate strongly with fat mass deposition, providing the insulation and energy reserves needed for homeostatic temperature control.
*   **Social Dominance:** While more famous for maternal care, *Peg1* is part of a "co-regulated network" with *Grb10*; paternal loss in this network is generally associated with shifts in aggressive competition and social rank.

### 3. Peg3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3)
*Peg3* is a "master regulator" of the maternal-fetal interface and hypothalamic development.

*   **Molecular Pathways:** It is a large **zinc-finger transcription factor** that modulates **TNFα-NFκB** (cell survival), **p53** (apoptosis), and **autophagy** pathways. It directly regulates the expression of **mitochondrial genes** and **oxytocin/vasopressin receptors**.
*   **Neurodevelopment:** It prevents programmed cell death in the hypothalamus, striatum, and amygdala. It is essential for the establishment of **sexual dimorphism** in the brain.
*   **Foraging:** *Peg3* is vital for "maternal foraging"—the behavioral drive to seek out and gather materials for nest-building and protecting offspring.
*   **Suckling:** In a classic example of coadaptation, *Peg3* acts in both the pup and the mother. *Peg3*-null pups are **weak sucklers**, while *Peg3*-null mothers fail in **milk let-down** due to a deficiency in hypothalamic oxytocin neurons.
*   **Thermoregulation:** *Peg3* is the primary imprinted gene linked to temperature control. *Peg3*-null pups are **chronically hypothermic** and cannot defend their body temperature when separated from the mother, often leading to death.
*   **Social Dominance:** In males, *Peg3* is required for **social dominance and competitiveness**. Deletion leads to a significant decrease in "wins" in social encounters (tube tests), linked to a reduction in vasopressinergic (AVP) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.

spawn_subagent -> The **Imprinted Brain Hypothesis**, proposed by Bernard Crespi and Christopher Badcock in 2008, suggests that the "social brain" is a product of a tug-of-war between maternal and paternal genes. This theory is an extension of David Haig’s **Kinship Theory of Genomic Imprinting**, which posits that paternal genes favor resource extraction from the mother (promoting growth), while maternal genes favor resource conservation (restricting growth).

Crespi and Badcock applied this logic to neurodevelopment, proposing a **diametric model** where the autism spectrum and the psychotic spectrum are clinical opposites driven by imbalancing this genetic conflict.

### 1. Paternal vs. Maternal Over-Expression
The hypothesis defines "normality" as a balance between maternal and paternal gene expression. When the balance shifts, it leads to distinct cognitive and developmental "styles":

*   **Paternal Over-expression (or Maternal Deficiency) $\rightarrow$ Autism Spectrum:**
    *   **Cognitive Style:** "Mechanistic" cognition. It involves an over-developed ability to understand the physical, non-human world (objects, patterns, systems) but a deficiency in understanding other minds.
    *   **Biological Outcome:** Paternally expressed genes are typically "growth-promoting." Over-expression results in brain **overgrowth** (larger head circumference in infancy) and increased demand on the mother.
    *   **Mentalism:** Hypo-mentalizing (an inability to perceive others' intentions, leading to social blindness).

*   **Maternal Over-expression (or Paternal Deficiency) $\rightarrow$ Psychotic Spectrum:**
    *   **Cognitive Style:** "Mentalistic" cognition. This involves an over-active perception of social intentions, agency, and meaning.
    *   **Biological Outcome:** Maternally expressed genes are typically "growth-limiting." Over-expression is associated with brain **undergrowth** (lower brain volumes in certain regions) and a more "tractable" or less demanding infant profile.
    *   **Mentalism:** Hyper-mentalizing (perceiving intention or meaning where none exists, leading to paranoia, delusions of reference, and hallucinations).

---

### 2. Clinical Syndromes: Paternal-Deficiency vs. Paternal-Excess

The most compelling evidence for this hypothesis comes from "imprinting disorders" where specific parental genes are missing or duplicated.

#### **Paternal-Deficiency Syndromes (Maternal Bias)**
*   **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Caused by the loss of paternally expressed genes on chromosome **15q11-q13** (often via maternal uniparental disomy, where the child has two maternal copies and no paternal copy).
    *   **Pathology:** PWS infants are famously "tractable"—they have a weak suck, low activity, and few demands.
    *   **Brain Development:** The hypothesis notes that PWS is characterized by a high risk of **psychosis** (up to 70% in cases of maternal disomy). Because the "growth-promoting" paternal genes are missing, the brain remains under maternal influence, leading to the hyper-mentalistic, psychotic phenotype.

#### **Paternal-Excess Syndromes (Paternal Bias)**
*   **Angelman Syndrome (AS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Caused by the loss of the *maternally* expressed gene $UBE3A$ in the same **15q11-q13** region, leaving the paternal genes to act unopposed (effectively a relative paternal-excess).
    *   **Pathology:** In contrast to PWS, AS children are often hyperactive, demanding, and exhibit a "happy demeanor" but severe social-cognitive deficits.
    *   **Brain Development:** AS is strongly associated with **autistic traits**. The unopposed paternal expression leads to a "mechanistic" bias and significant deficits in language and social reciprocity, fitting the "extreme paternal brain" model.

*   **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Caused by the over-expression of the paternal gene **$IGF2$** (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) or the loss of maternal imprinting on chromosome **11p15**.
    *   **Pathology:** BWS is a classic **overgrowth syndrome**. Infants are born large (macrosomia) with enlarged organs (e.g., macroglossia/large tongue). 
    *   **Brain Development:** In line with the hypothesis, BWS is associated with a significantly increased risk of **autism**. The excess of $IGF2$ (a paternal growth-promoter) drives the brain toward the "mechanistic" extreme, manifesting in the systemic overgrowth and cognitive profile characteristic of the autism spectrum.

spawn_subagent -> Epigenetic mechanisms ensure that paternally expressed genes (PEGs) are transcribed exclusively from the paternal allele in the brain through a coordinated interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications. This "parent-of-origin" monoallelic expression is vital for neurodevelopment, and its disruption by environmental factors can lead to long-term behavioral and cognitive impairments.

### 1. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Monoallelic Expression
The monoallelic expression of PEGs is primarily controlled by **Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs)** or **Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs)**. These regions are "marked" in the parental germline and maintained throughout brain development.

#### DNA Methylation Processes
*   **Establishment & Maintenance:** In PEGs, the maternal allele is typically silenced by hypermethylation at its promoter or ICR, while the paternal allele remains unmethylated and transcriptionally active.
*   **Key Enzymes:**
    *   **DNMT1:** The primary maintenance methyltransferase that copies methylation patterns during cell division.
    *   **DNMT3A:** Critically important in the brain, DNMT3A is highly expressed in postmitotic neurons. It is responsible for *de novo* methylation and the maintenance of non-CpG (CpH) methylation, which is a unique feature of the neuronal epigenome that accumulates during synaptogenesis.
*   **MBDs (Methyl-CpG Binding Domain proteins):** Proteins like **MeCP2** bind to methylated maternal alleles and recruit corepressor complexes (e.g., Sin3A, HDACs) to reinforce silencing.

#### Histone Modification Processes
Histone marks act in tandem with DNA methylation to create an "open" or "closed" chromatin state.
*   **Repressive Marks (Maternal Allele):**
    *   **H3K9me2/3:** Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 is a hallmark of silenced imprinted alleles. The histone methyltransferase **G9a (EHMT2)** is essential for maintaining this mark at PEGs like *Snrpn*. G9a can be recruited by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to form a heterochromatin complex in *cis*.
    *   **H3K27me3:** Deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), this mark further stabilizes silencing.
*   **Activating Marks (Paternal Allele):**
    *   **H3K4me2/3 & H3K27ac:** The active paternal allele is characterized by high levels of acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation, which promote an open chromatin structure accessible to RNA polymerase II.
*   **CTCF Insulators:** The **CTCF** protein binds only to the *unmethylated* paternal allele at certain ICRs (e.g., *Peg3*, *Mest*). This binding acts as an insulator, preventing the allele from being silenced by nearby repressive elements or allowing it to access tissue-specific enhancers.

### 2. Environmental Impacts on the Developing Brain
Environmental stressors and chemical exposures can "reprogram" these epigenetic marks, leading to **Loss of Imprinting (LOI)**, where a gene becomes biallelically expressed or completely silenced.

#### Impact of Stress (Prenatal & Early Life)
*   **Alteration of PEG Expression:** Research shows that prenatal stress (e.g., maternal depression or anxiety) is associated with reduced expression of **PEG3** and **MEST** in the placenta and offspring brain.
*   **Methylation Shifts:** High levels of maternal stress have been linked to **increased DNA methylation** at the *MEST* DMR in infants, which is associated with altered HPA axis reactivity and behavioral problems.
*   **Histone Remodeling:** Stress increases the expression of **HDAC1** and **HDAC2** (histone deacetylases) in the hippocampus, leading to a global decrease in histone acetylation (e.g., **AcH3K14**). This results in a more condensed chromatin state that can suppress the expression of PEGs required for synaptic plasticity.

#### Impact of Endocrine Disruptors (BPA & Phthalates)
*   **Bisphenol A (BPA):** BPA is an estrogenic mimic that interferes with the "writers" and "erasers" of epigenetic marks.
    *   **LOI and Transgenerational Effects:** Exposure to BPA has been shown to cause a loss of imprinting at the *Meg3* and *Igf2* loci. In some studies, these changes persisted into the **F3 generation**, suggesting that endocrine disruptors can permanently alter the germline imprint.
    *   **Enzyme Interference:** BPA can disrupt the activity of **DNMT3A** and **SIRT1** (a histone deacetylase), leading to sex-specific changes in brain methylation patterns and subsequent social and anxiety-like behaviors.
*   **Phthalates:** Similar to BPA, phthalates (like DEHP) can cause relaxation of imprinting. They are particularly noted for affecting the **Rtl1** gene, which is vital for placental and brain development, leading to growth restriction and neurodevelopmental delays.
