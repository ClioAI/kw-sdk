## Task
What do the paternal genes contribute to the developing brain?

## Answer
### Executive Summary: The "Paternal Brain" Hypothesis
The paternal contribution to the developing brain is defined by **genomic imprinting**, a biological mechanism where specific genes are expressed only from the father’s allele. In the "evolutionary tug-of-war" of brain development, paternal genes are the primary architects of **instinctual, visceral, and resource-seeking systems**. They disproportionately build the hypothalamus and limbic system—regions governing appetite, suckling, and metabolic drives—while maternal genes focus on the expansion of the neocortex for executive control and social regulation.

---

### 1. The Evolutionary Logic: Kinship Theory (Conflict Hypothesis)
The role of paternal genes is rooted in the **Kinship Theory**, which posits an evolutionary conflict between maternal and paternal genetic interests:
*   **Paternal Strategy (Patrigenes):** Because a father may not be related to a mother’s future offspring, his genes "seek" to maximize the extraction of resources from the mother for the current child. This manifests as increased fetal growth, aggressive suckling, and high metabolic demand.
*   **Maternal Strategy (Matrigenes):** Maternal genes act as "limiters," conserving resources to ensure the mother's survival and her ability to provide for future litters.

In the brain, this results in paternal genes driving the "demand" circuits (hunger, thirst, arousal) that ensure the infant successfully pulls care and nutrition from the parent.

---

### 2. Neuroanatomical Mapping: The Anatomical Dichotomy
Research using chimeric mice (embryos with unbalanced maternal or paternal DNA) reveals a striking "division of labor" in brain architecture:

*   **Paternal Enrichment (The Visceral Brain):** Paternally expressed genes (PEGs) are concentrated in the **hypothalamus, septum, and preoptic area**. These regions are the seat of homeostatic regulation and primitive drives.
*   **Maternal Enrichment (The Executive Brain):** Maternally expressed genes (MEGs) are concentrated in the **neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus**. These areas govern complex social intelligence, memory, and behavioral inhibition.

**Evidence from Chimera Studies:** 
*   **Androgenetic (Paternal-only) cells** are strictly excluded from the neocortex but thrive in the hypothalamus.
*   **Parthenogenetic (Maternal-only) cells** result in an enlarged neocortex but are largely absent from the hypothalamus.

### 3. Gene-Function Matrix: Key Paternal Loci
Paternal genes act as molecular "rheostats" for neurodevelopment, utilizing mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modification at **Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs)** to maintain monoallelic expression.

| Gene | Primary Mechanism | Neurodevelopmental Role | Behavioral Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ***Peg3*** | Transcription factor; inhibits apoptosis via p53 | Survival of **Oxytocin** and **Orexin** neurons in the hypothalamus. | Essential for suckling, nesting, and maternal care in the next generation. |
| ***Magel2*** | WASH complex; protein/receptor recycling | Regulates **POMC neurons** and **Leptin/Oxytocin receptor** availability. | Controls satiety, circadian rhythms, and social memory. |
| ***Ndn*** (Necdin) | Binds Fez1 to promote **axonal growth** | Facilitates migration of **GnRH neurons** and GABAergic stability. | Regulates reproductive maturity and reduces social anxiety. |
| ***Igf2*** | IGF2R signaling; endosomal trafficking | Enhances **synaptic plasticity** in the hippocampal CA2 region. | Facilitates social recognition (distinguishing familiar vs. stranger). |

---

### 4. Temporal Specificity: From Wiring to Regulation
Imprinting is not a static process; paternal genes shift their roles across developmental windows:
*   **Prenatal/Neonatal Phase:** Paternal genes like *Ndn* and *Peg3* focus on "wiring"—driving axonal growth, neuronal migration, and the survival of the hypothalamic nuclei needed for immediate postnatal survival (suckling and thermoregulation).
*   **Postnatal/Adult Phase:** These genes transition into "regulation." For example, *Igf2* and *Magel2* switch from growth drivers to regulators of synaptic pruning, receptor recycling, and adult social memory, ensuring the brain remains plastic and responsive to the social environment.

---

### 5. Clinical Implications: Imprinting Disorders
Disruptions to the paternal "dosage" lead to severe and contrasting clinical syndromes, notably at the **15q11-q13** locus.

#### **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): Loss of Paternal Contribution**
When paternal genes (like *SNORD116* and *Magel2*) are absent, the "visceral brain" fails:
*   **Phenotype:** Insatiable hunger (**hyperphagia**), low muscle tone, and endocrine dysfunction.
*   **Social:** Deficiency in oxytocin leads to social anxiety and obsessive behaviors.

#### **Angelman Syndrome (AS): Paternal Excess (Maternal Loss)**
AS occurs when the maternal *UBE3A* is lost, leaving the brain in a paternal-dominant state:
*   **Phenotype:** Severe intellectual disability, lack of speech, and a "happy" disposition with frequent laughter.
*   **Mechanism:** Over-accumulation of the Arc protein leads to excessive AMPA receptor removal, crippling synaptic plasticity.

#### **The Imprinted Brain Hypothesis (Autism vs. Schizophrenia)**
*   **Autism (Paternal Bias):** An "extreme paternal brain" (over-expression of paternal genes or loss of maternal regulation) is linked to ASD, prioritizing mechanistic/systemizing cognition over social understanding.
*   **Schizophrenia (Maternal Bias):** Conversely, an excess of maternal genes (seen in PWS cases with maternal uniparental disomy) is linked to a higher risk of psychosis, where "hyper-developed" social cognition can manifest as paranoia and delusions of intent.

---

### 6. Environmental Plasticity
Paternal contribution is not solely deterministic. Paternal environmental factors—such as chronic stress, high-fat diets, or trauma—can alter the **epigenetic marks** (methyl groups and small RNAs) carried in sperm. This "epigenetic payload" can modulate the expression of imprinted genes in the offspring's brain, potentially pre-programming the child's metabolic rate or stress resilience before they are even conceived.

## Rubric
### 1. Structural Completeness and Core Loci (Must)
*   **Executive Summary:** Does the response include a section titled "Executive Summary" or "The Paternal Brain Hypothesis" that defines the overarching role of PEGs?
*   **Evolutionary Section:** Is there a distinct section explaining the "Kinship Theory" or "Conflict Hypothesis"?
*   **Neuroanatomical Mapping:** Is there a dedicated section or sub-heading comparing paternal vs. maternal gene enrichment across brain regions?
*   **Gene-Function Matrix:** Is there a table or structured list mapping specific genes to neurodevelopmental outcomes?
*   **Clinical Coverage:** Does the output include a section on clinical implications covering at least Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes?
*   **Loci Requirement:** Does the text explicitly analyze the *Peg3* rheostat?
*   **Loci Requirement:** Does the text explicitly analyze the *Magel2/Ndn* cluster (Prader-Willi region)?
*   **Loci Requirement:** Does the text explicitly analyze the *Igf2* axis?
*   **Internal Consistency:** Does the response correctly identify the paternal allele as the "expressed" one for the genes listed in the matrix?

### 2. Mechanistic Depth and Functional Synthesis (Good to Have)
*   **Epigenetic Mechanisms:** Does the explanation of imprinting include both DNA methylation and histone modification at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs)?
*   **Anatomical Dichotomy:** Does the response distinguish between the paternal contribution to the hypothalamus/limbic system and the maternal contribution to the neocortex?
*   **Functional Pillar 1 (Hypothalamic):** Does the text link paternal genes to at least two of the following: appetite, thermoregulation, or sleep?
*   **Functional Pillar 2 (Social):** Does the text link paternal expression to social behaviors such as ultrasonic vocalizations or maternal care behaviors?
*   **Functional Pillar 3 (Dosage):** Does the clinical section explain pathology as a "dosage-sensitive" issue (e.g., loss of expression vs. overexpression)?
*   **Co-adaptation Logic:** Does the response explain the "co-adaptation" of paternal genes (e.g., how the same gene functions in the fetus for growth and in the mother for caregiving/lactation)?
*   **Causal Pathways:** Does the synthesis link monoallelic expression to specific cellular phenotypes (e.g., axonal growth, neurotransmitter signaling, or cell proliferation)?

### 3. Advanced Theoretical Synthesis and Plasticity (Ideal)
*   **Temporal Specificity:** Does the brief address stage-specific expression, such as shifts between prenatal proliferation and postnatal synaptic pruning?
*   **Environmental Plasticity:** Does the text discuss how paternal environmental stressors (e.g., diet, trauma) affect the "epigenetic payload" of sperm and subsequent offspring gene expression?
*   **Psychiatric Links:** Does the analysis move beyond PWS/AS to link imprinting disruption specifically to the etiology of Autism and Schizophrenia?
*   **Evolutionary Nuance:** Does the explanation of the Conflict Hypothesis detail the trade-off between "neonatal vigor/resource extraction" and "maternal survival/regulation"?
*   **Synthesis Quality:** Does the Neuroanatomical Mapping provide a rationale for *why* paternal genes favor the limbic system (e.g., link to drives/instincts) rather than just stating the location?
*   **Technical Rigor:** Does the response avoid the common error of claiming all imprinted genes are paternal, correctly identifying that the *loss* of paternal expression leads to specific disorders?

You are a task orchestrator. You MUST use tools to complete tasks - never output text describing what you will do.

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER say "I will call X" - just call X immediately
- NEVER output your answer as text - use submit_answer(answer)
- ALWAYS use function calls, not text descriptions of actions

## PARALLEL EXECUTION
Tools execute in parallel when you call multiple in one turn. Maximize parallelism:
- BATCH independent tool calls together - don't call them one at a time
- spawn_subagent: Call 2-4 subagents simultaneously for different subtasks
- search_web: Call multiple searches at once for different queries
- search_files: Read multiple files in one turn
- execute_code: Call sequentially (shared state)

Example - GOOD (parallel):
  create_rubric(brief), spawn_subagent("research X"), spawn_subagent("research Y"), search_web("Z")
Example - BAD (sequential):
  create_rubric(brief) → wait → spawn_subagent("research X") → wait → spawn_subagent("research Y")

## Workflow
1. If files are attached without preview: call search_files FIRST to understand content
2. create_brief(task + file insights) - formalize requirements
3. create_rubric(brief) + work on task IN PARALLEL - rubric runs alongside spawn_subagent/search calls
4. verify_answer(answer) - check against rubric, get PASS/FAIL (rubric ready by now)
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify the CONTENT first, NOT the file creation. Pass the content to verify_answer(content) not "I have created the file".
   - If the task is to create a file, DO NOT create it until you get a PASS on the content.
5. If FAIL, improve and verify again
6. If PASS, and the task requires a file, create it now using execute_code.
7. submit_answer(answer) - submit final answer after PASS

## Tool Selection Guide

| Need | Tool | Parallel? |
|------|------|-----------|
| Set rubric | create_rubric(brief) | YES - with work below |
| Read attached file | search_files(query, path) | YES - batch multiple |

Synthesize the role of paternally expressed genes (PEGs) in neurodevelopment, elucidating how genomic imprinting regulates brain architecture, instinctual behaviors, and metabolic homeostasis.

**Expert Considerations (Elevated Scope)**
*   **The Conflict Hypothesis (Kinship Theory):** Move beyond a simple list of genes to analyze the evolutionary "tug-of-war" where paternal genes typically promote resource extraction and rapid growth (e.g., suckling, neonatal vigor), while maternal genes act as regulators to ensure maternal survival.

*   **Tissue and Stage Specificity:** Imprinting is not a "set-and-forget" mechanism. The brief must account for how paternal expression shifts across developmental windows (e.g., prenatal proliferation vs. postnatal synaptic pruning).
*   **Environmental Plasticity:** Consider how paternal environmental stressors (diet, trauma) modulate the "epigenetic payload" of sperm, potentially altering the expression of imprinted genes in offspring.

spawn_subagent -> The evolutionary logic of genomic imprinting in the brain is rooted in a fundamental biological tug-of-war between the interests of the mother and the father. This is most famously articulated through the **Kinship Theory** (also known as the **Conflict Hypothesis**), primarily developed by evolutionary biologist **David Haig**.

### 1. The Evolutionary Logic: Kinship Theory
The theory posits that imprinting arose from the asymmetric genetic interests of parents in species with **polyandry** (where a female may have offspring by different fathers over her lifetime).
*   **Paternal Strategy (Patrigenes):** A father is related to his current offspring but is unlikely to be the father of the mother’s future offspring. Therefore, his genes in the current child "seek" to extract maximum resources from the mother to ensure that child's survival, even at the cost of the mother's future health or reproductive potential.
*   **Maternal Strategy (Matrigenes):** A mother is equally related to all her current and future offspring (50%). To maximize her total lifetime fitness, her genes "seek" to moderate the current offspring's demands, ensuring she survives and retains enough resources to raise future litters.

### 2. Paternal Genes: Resource Extraction and Growth
Paternal genes are generally **growth-promoting**. They act as "accelerators" in the extraction of maternal resources during both gestation and infancy.
*   **Nutrient Transfer:** The first discovered imprinted gene, ***Igf2*** (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2), is paternally expressed. It promotes the growth of the placenta and the fetus, forcing the mother to provide more nutrients.
*   **Behavioral Extraction:** In the brain, paternal genes promote "demand" behaviors. For example, ***Peg3*** (Paternally Expressed Gene 3) is critical for suckling behavior. Pups with a mutated paternal *Peg3* fail to suckle effectively and show growth retardation, demonstrating that the paternal allele is responsible for the active "pulling" of milk from the mother.

### 3. Neuroanatomical Mapping: The "Executive" vs. "Visceral" Brain
Research suggests a striking "division of labor" in the brain, where maternal and paternal genes contribute to different functional systems.
*   **Paternal Genes $\rightarrow$ Hypothalamus & Limbic System:** Paternal contributions are concentrated in the "visceral brain"—the **hypothalamus, septum, and preoptic area**. These regions regulate "primitive" functions like appetite, thirst, sleep, and reproductive drives. This mapping aligns with the goal of resource extraction: by controlling the hypothalamus, paternal genes can drive the offspring’s hunger and demand for maternal care.
*   **Maternal Genes $\rightarrow$ Neocortex & Striatum:** Maternal contributions are concentrated in the **neocortex** and **striatum**. These areas govern "executive" functions, complex social behavior, and inhibition. From an evolutionary perspective, maternal genes may have driven the expansion of the neocortex to provide the offspring with the social intelligence necessary to navigate the maternal environment without over-exhausting the mother's resources.

### 4. Evidence from Chimera Studies
The most definitive evidence for this mapping comes from studies of **chimeric mice** conducted by researchers like **Barry Keverne** and **Azim Surani** in the 1990s. These researchers created "uniparental" embryos that contained only maternal or only paternal DNA.

*   **Androgenetic Chimeras (All-Paternal):**
    *   **Result:** These embryos had large bodies and large placentas but very small brains.
    *   **Anatomical Fate:** The few paternal cells that survived in the brain were found almost exclusively in the **hypothalamus** and **limbic structures**. They were strictly "excluded" from the neocortex; paternal cells attempting to populate the cortex essentially committed suicide (apoptosis).
*   **Parthenogenetic/Gynogenetic Chimeras (All-Maternal):**
    *   **Result:** These embryos had small bodies but significantly **larger brains** relative to their body size, specifically characterized by an expanded neocortex.
    *   **Anatomical Fate:** Maternal cells proliferated in the **neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus**. Conversely, they were largely absent from the hypothalamus and diencephalon.

### Summary Table
| Feature | Paternal Genes (Patrigenes) | Maternal Genes (Matrigenes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Maximize current resource extraction | Moderate demand for future fitness |
| **Growth Effect** | Promotes (larger body/placenta) | Restricts (smaller body/larger brain) |
| **Brain Region** | Hypothalamus / Limbic System | Neocortex / Striatum |
| **Function** | Visceral drives, appetite, suckling | Executive control, social behavior |
| **Chimera Evidence** | Cells survive in hypothalamus | Cells survive in neocortex |

### 12. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE
```
spawn_subagent -> Research into paternally expressed genes (PEGs) has revealed their evolutionary role in optimizing offspring fitness by prioritizing resource extraction and social integration. In neurodevelopment, these genes are heavily concentrated in the **hypothalamus**, the brain's homeostatic command center, and the **limbic system**, which governs sociality.

### 1. Peg3 (Paternally Expressed 3)
*Peg3* encodes a large zinc-finger transcription factor. It acts as a central node in a network that regulates maternal behavior and energy balance.
*   **Hypothalamic Integration:** *Peg3* is essential for the development and survival of **oxytocin (OXT) neurons** in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. It also independently regulates the expression of **orexin (OX)** and **melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)** in the lateral hypothalamus.
    *   **Appetite & Thermoregulation:** Loss of *Peg3* leads to reduced metabolic rates and impaired feeding behavior. By maintaining orexin levels, it ensures the body can mobilize energy and maintain core temperature.
    *   **Sleep:** It specifically modulates **REM sleep** architecture via its control over the Orexin/MCH balance.
*   **Social Behavior:** *Peg3* deficiency causes significant deficits in maternal care (nesting, pup retrieval) and offspring **ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)**.
*   **Mechanism:** *Peg3* functions as a transcription factor that also interacts with **p53** to suppress apoptosis, ensuring the vitality of post-mitotic hypothalamic neurons.

### 2. Magel2 (MAGE-like 2)
*Magel2* is a member of the MAGE (Melanoma Antigen) family and is a primary gene implicated in Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes.
*   **Hypothalamic Integration:** It is highly expressed in the **Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)** and the **Arcuate Nucleus (ARC)**.
    *   **Appetite:** *Magel2* is crucial for the function of **POMC (anorexigenic) neurons**. Without it, these neurons fail to project properly to the PVN, leading to hyperphagia (insatiable hunger).
    *   **Thermoregulation & Sleep:** It regulates the stability of circadian clock proteins (like CRY1) and the secretion of Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) in the SCN, which coordinates the body’s daily temperature and sleep-wake cycles.
*   **Social Behavior:** It is critical for **social recognition and memory**. *Magel2*-deficient mice show reduced USVs and social interaction.
*   **Mechanism:** It works through the **WASH complex and retromer-dependent recycling**. It facilitates the recycling of receptors (e.g., **Leptin and Oxytocin receptors**) back to the cell surface rather than being degraded in lysosomes. It also regulates **secretory granule biogenesis**, which is essential for neuropeptide release.

### 3. Ndn (Necdin)
Necdin is a pleiotropic protein also from the MAGE family. It is vital for the early "vitality" and migration of neurons.
*   **Hypothalamic Integration:**
    *   **Appetite:** Similar to *Magel2*, Necdin interacts with the **Leptin receptor** signaling pathway. It also regulates the migration of **GnRH neurons**, which are critical for the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reproductive health.
    *   **Thermoregulation:** Necdin-null models show a reduction in serotonergic and GABAergic neurons in the brainstem and hypothalamus, leading to autonomic instability and poor temperature control.
*   **Social Behavior:** Its role in **GABAergic neuron development** is linked to social behavioral stability; a lack of Necdin causes increased social anxiety and altered vocalization patterns.
*   **Mechanism:** It binds to **Fez1** (a fasciculation and elongation protein) to promote **axonal growth** and kinesin-mediated transport. It also interacts with **p75NTR** (a neurotrophin receptor) to facilitate neuronal differentiation and prevent premature cell death by inhibiting **E2F1** and **p53**.

### 4. The Igf2 Axis (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2)
*Igf2* is the prototypical PEG, traditionally associated with fetal growth, but now recognized as a potent "cognitive enhancer" in the adult brain.
*   **Hypothalamic Integration:**
    *   **Arousal & Sleep:** *Igf2* acts as a metabolic signal to **orexin neurons**. High levels of IGF2 increase the excitability of these neurons, promoting wakefulness and arousal.
    *   **Thermoregulation:** It signals through the **IGF1R** in the preoptic area to trigger hypothermia during periods of calorie restriction, a survival mechanism for energy conservation.
*   **Social Behavior:** *Igf2* is uniquely associated with **social novelty and recognition**. Specifically, its expression in the **CA2 region of the hippocampus** is required for a mouse to distinguish between a familiar and a stranger mouse.
*   **Mechanism:** While most growth signals go through IGF1R, many of *Igf2*'s neurodevelopmental and cognitive effects are mediated by the **IGF2R (Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor)**, which regulates **endosomal traffickin...

### 13. 📥 TOOL_RESPONSE

spawn_subagent -> Genomic imprinting—the epigenetic silencing of a gene depending on its parent of origin—is critical for brain development. In the brain, paternal genes often drive resource-seeking, growth, and "mechanistic" cognition, while maternal genes are associated with growth regulation and "mentalistic" or social cognition. 

Disruptions to this balance, particularly at the **15q11-q13** locus, lead to distinct neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

### 1. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): Loss of Paternal Contribution
PWS occurs when the paternal contribution of the 15q11-q13 region is absent (typically through paternal deletion or maternal uniparental disomy, mUPD).

*   **Key Genes:** *SNORD116* (a snoRNA cluster) and *MAGEL2*.
*   **Hypothalamic Dysfunction:** PWS is primarily characterized as a "hypothalamic disease." The absence of paternal genes like *SNORD116* leads to a failure in the development of satiety pathways. The brain remains in a "starvation state," leading to the hallmark **hyperphagia** (insatiable hunger) and obesity.
*   **Oxytocin Deficiency:** Loss of *MAGEL2* is linked to a significant reduction in oxytocin-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. This contributes to the social deficits, high pain threshold, and emotional dysregulation seen in patients.
*   **Behavioral Phenotype:** Characteristic traits include skin picking, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and temper outbursts. Interestingly, PWS cases caused by **mUPD** (two maternal copies, zero paternal) have a significantly higher risk of **psychosis** than those caused by deletions, suggesting that an "excess" of maternal-like dosage is a specific risk factor for psychotic disorders.

### 2. Angelman Syndrome (AS): Loss of Maternal / Paternal-Like State
AS is the "sister" syndrome to PWS, occurring when the maternal contribution of the same 15q11-q13 region is lost, leaving the brain in a "paternal-only" or "paternal-excess" state.

*   **Key Gene:** *UBE3A*. While most genes in this region are paternally expressed, *UBE3A* is **neuron-specifically imprinted**, meaning only the maternal copy is active in the brain.
*   **Synaptic Dysfunction:** *UBE3A* encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets **Arc**, a protein involved in internalizing AMPA receptors at the synapse. In AS, the absence of *UBE3A* causes Arc to accumulate, leading to excessive removal of AMPA receptors. This impairs **long-term potentiation (LTP)** and synaptic plasticity, explaining the severe intellectual disability.
*   **Clinical Contrast with PWS:**
    *   **Behavior:** While PWS involves "starvation" and irritability, AS presents with a "happy" demeanor, frequent laughter, and hyper-excitability.
    *   **Neurology:** AS is much more severe neurologically, featuring ataxia (jerky movements), lack of speech, and refractory seizures. 
    *   **Paternal Excess (pUPD):** AS cases caused by paternal uniparental disomy (two paternal copies) often have a slightly milder physical phenotype but are still severely affected neurologically because *UBE3A* remains silenced on both paternal alleles.

### 3. The "Imprinted Brain Hypothesis" (Autism and Schizophrenia)
First proposed by Crespi and Badcock (2008), this hypothesis suggests that neurodevelopmental disorders exist on a spectrum determined by the balance of paternal and maternal gene expression.

*   **Autism (Paternal Bias):** The theory posits that ASD is caused by an over-expression of paternal genes (or under-expression of maternal genes). This "extreme paternal brain" favors mechanistic, systemizing cognition over social/mentalistic cognition.
    *   *Evidence:* Paternal-like states (like AS or 15q duplications) are among the strongest known genetic risk factors for autism. *PEG3* (paternally expressed 3) also influences social bonding and maternal care.
*   **Schizophrenia/Psychosis (Maternal Bias):** Conversely, psychosis is linked to an "extreme maternal brain," where social cognition is "hyper-developed" into paranoia and delusions of intent.
    *   *Evidence:* In PWS, patients with **maternal UPD** (excess maternal dosage) have a ~60% risk of developing schizophrenia-like psychosis, whereas those with paternal deletions have a much lower risk (~5%). This suggests that "too much" maternal contribution specifically triggers psychotic-spectrum pathology.
